## From Forced Disconnection to Mutual Reconnection

A soil story about milpa ecology, technology and intelligence…

The land is a source of identity. 
Land is the solid surface of the Earth.

Ancestral knowledge, languages, cultural practices and oral traditions built up over the millennia are all connected to the land. The values of reciprocity, respect, balance, and connection to spirituality are central to learning from the land. Learning from the land presents an opportunity for us to learn more about the histories and stories of the land and the beings that make our ecosystems.

The connection to the land has been disrupted through policies of colonization, assimilation, and genocide. Forced disconnection from the land has caused spiritual, emotional, physical, and mental damage to many beings on Earth.

Are we prepared to re-evaluate our relationship with the many life forms with whom we share the planet?

… drawing on Indigenous and rural ways of knowing that have long recognized the significance of non-human modes of being . . .this interaction is trying to synthesise ways of communication with the soil; the soil that reaps our food systems and the urgent need to do so given the reality of looming ecological collapse . . .
